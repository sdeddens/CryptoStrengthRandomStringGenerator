# CryptoStrengthRandomStringGenerator
Generates cryptographic strength random strings (secrets / keys / passwords ); written in C#. The .NET RNGCryptoServiceProvider is used as the random index source. The string generated is insured to have at least one character from each of four separate sub-pools of characters; numbers, lower case, uppercase, and special. The maximum length of the generated string allowed is 65536 characters.

Discussion: There is a problem with the random source as it only returns byte chunks of random bits. This can introduce a bias into a solution when using the bytes as an index into a selection string. (ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32932679/using-rngcryptoserviceprovider-to-generate-random-string) This issue is overcome by using a subset of the random returned bits. The subset must be large enough to hold the largest index needed.  Any returned subset that has a numerical value larger than the max index is discarded and a new random set is retrieved.
